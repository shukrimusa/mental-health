                <h1>Depression</h1>
                <p>Depression is a mental health condition marked by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in daily activities. It can lead to changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and energy levels. Individuals may experience difficulty concentrating, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and, in severe cases, thoughts of self-harm. Depression affects one's overall quality of life and can be caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Treatment often involves therapy, medication, and support to help manage symptoms and promote recovery. Early recognition and intervention are crucial for effective depression management.</p>
                 <h2>What signs of depression?</h2>
                 <p>Signs of depression include persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed. Changes in sleep patterns, appetite, and energy levels may occur. Concentration difficulties, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and recurring thoughts of death or suicide are common. Physical symptoms like headaches or digestive issues may manifest. Social withdrawal, irritability, and a sense of emptiness are also indicators. Depression affects daily functioning and can lead to a decline in work or school performance. Recognizing these signs, seeking professional help, and building a support system are crucial for effective management. Early intervention promotes recovery through therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes.</p>
