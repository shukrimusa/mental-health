        <h1>Stress</h1>
        
        <p>Stress is a natural physiological and psychological response to challenges or demands, often known as stressors, that individuals encounter in their lives. It triggers the body's "fight or flight" mechanism, releasing hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Common stressors include work pressures, life changes, or unexpected events. While short-term stress can be motivating and help cope with challenges, chronic stress can have negative health effects, impacting sleep, immune function, and mental well-being.

            Physical symptoms of stress may include headaches, muscle tension, and digestive issues. Emotionally, it can lead to anxiety, irritability, or a sense of being overwhelmed. Effective stress management involves adopting coping strategies such as exercise, relaxation techniques, time management, and seeking support. Understanding and addressing the sources of stress can contribute to better overall health and resilience in navigating life's challenges.</p>
       <h2>What are signs of stress?</h2>
       <p>Signs of stress include physical symptoms like headaches, muscle tension, and digestive issues. Emotionally, stress can manifest as anxiety, irritability, and a feeling of being overwhelmed. Changes in sleep patterns, appetite, and energy levels may occur. Cognitive symptoms may involve difficulty concentrating and racing thoughts. Behavioral signs include changes in social interaction, withdrawal, or increased use of substances. Chronic stress can negatively impact overall well-being and may contribute to health issues. Recognizing these signs, implementing stress management techniques, and seeking support can help mitigate the effects of stress and promote better mental and physical health.</p>
